Omni is a Windows box but with the fun twist of being a small IoT device.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

Performing an Nmap scan reveals the following ports open on the remote host.

```shell
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Sat Feb  5 09:05:31 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -p- -o allnmap -v -Pn 10.10.10.204

```

Going to the site at 10.10.10.104:8080 gives us a login site for a site called "Windows Device Portal". This is good information!

Googling for "Windows Device Portal Exploit" (super complicated I know) gives us a result for a tool called [SirepRAT](https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT).

### Remote Code Execution

Using SirepRAT, we can execute code on the remote machine and receive a remote shell on the target machine!

To begin, we are going to do the tried and trusted http server hosting through Python and upload nc.exe to the victim host.

```shell
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Once nc.exe is uploaded to the host we can execute and receive a reverse shell on the victim!
